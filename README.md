# Swerve-Drive Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) for Inventory Management

## Problem Statement

Modern industrial environments demand increasingly agile and efficient Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to optimize material handling and logistics. This project addresses the need for enhanced maneuverability and precision in AGVs through the implementation of a swerve drive system, coupled with autonomous navigation capabilities, specifically tailored for inventory management tasks.

## Project Overview

This senior capstone project focuses on the design, development, and implementation of a Swerve-Drive Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) designed to improve inventory management within industrial settings. The swerve drive mechanism allows for independent control of each wheel's speed and direction, providing exceptional maneuverability, including omnidirectional movement and rotation about a central axis.

The AGV will be equipped with sensors and a control system enabling autonomous navigation within a defined environment. This includes path planning, obstacle avoidance, and precise positioning for inventory-related tasks such as locating and transporting items.
